## üìú Description

As the inaugural project of the **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge, Echo Buddy serves as a "Talking Tom" clone built entirely with modern web technologies. The goal was to explore the browser's powerful audio APIs in a fun and visual way. The application captures audio from a user's microphone, processes it with different voice filters, and plays it back, all while animating a character on screen in real-time.

This project is a perfect example of "Vibe Coding"‚Äîusing AI as a creative collaborator to quickly move from idea to a polished, deployed application.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-time Audio Recording:** Captures audio using the `MediaRecorder` API.
-   **Automatic Silence Detection:** Intelligently detects when the user stops speaking to end the recording.
-   **Continuous Loop Mode:** Once a session is started, it continuously listens and repeats, creating an interactive loop.
-   **Voice Filters:** Apply fun audio effects powered by **Tone.js**:
    -   Normal
    -   High Pitch (Chipmunk)
    -   Low Pitch (Deep Voice)
    -   Robot (BitCrusher effect)
-   **Dynamic Character:** The character's color changes based on the selected filter.
-   **Live Lip-Sync:** The character's mouth animates in real-time based on the volume of the playback audio.
-   **Responsive Design:** A clean, mobile-first interface built with Tailwind CSS.
